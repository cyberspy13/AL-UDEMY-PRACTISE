Exercise Scenario: Online Store Discount

You are developing an online store application, and you need to implement a simple discount 
calculation for a customer's purchase. The discount is a fixed 10% on the total purchase amount.

1. Create a Codeunit (e.g., "OnlineStoreDiscount"):
• Define a procedure named CalculateTotalWithDiscount that does not take any 
parameters.
• Inside the procedure, declare a variable for the total purchase amount (e.g., 
TotalAmount) and calculate the discounted total (10% off) based on a predefined 
purchase amount (e.g., 200.00).

2. Call the Procedure in a Main Section:
• Create a main procedure that calls CalculateTotalWithDiscount.
• Display the original total and the discounted total in a message dialog.

3. Run the Application:
• Run the codeunit to see the results.
