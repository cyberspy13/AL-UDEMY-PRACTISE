Exercise
Exercise Scenario: Employee Leave Calculation
Scenario: You are developing a human resources application for a company to manage employee 
leaves. The system stores employee information in a table called EmployeeInfo with fields such as 
EmployeeID, EmployeeName, TotalLeaves, and LeavesTaken. The task is to calculate the remaining 
leaves for each employee based on the total leaves allowed and the leaves already taken.
Instructions:
1. You need to iterate through the EmployeeInfo table to calculate the remaining leaves for each 
employee.
2. If an employee has taken more leaves than the allowed total, they are considered to have a 
negative leave balance.
3. Display a message for each employee indicating their leave balance status (e.g., "Positive Leave 
Balance," "Zero Leave Balance," or "Negative Leave Balance")
