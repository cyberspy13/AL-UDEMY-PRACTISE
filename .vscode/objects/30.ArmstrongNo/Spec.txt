Armstrong No. logic:

Examples of Armstrong Numbers
Example 1: 153

To determine if 153 is an Armstrong number:
Count the digits: 153 has 3 digits.
Raise each digit to the power of 3 and sum them: (1^3 = 1) (5^3 = 125) (3^3 = 27)
Sum these values: (1 + 125 + 27 = 153)

How to implement in the code:

1. We need to take the input as a variable. Seems like it is going to be an Integers - DONE
2. Count how many digits the input number. - DONE
3. Store this digit in the var. - DONE
4. Take each digit and multiply by the quantity of the input number. - DONE	
5. Sum all multiplied values.- DONE
6. Compare with original input value.- DONE
7. If these numbers are the same we should have notification message says: - "This number is Armstrong No." or "This number is not an Armstrong no." - DONE
